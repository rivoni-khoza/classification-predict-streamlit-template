This process requires the user to input text
(ideally a tweet relating to climate change), and will
classify it according to whether or not they believe in
climate change.Below you will find information about the data source
and a brief data description. You can have a look at word clouds and
other general Exploratory Data Analysis on the Insights page, and make your predictions on the prediction page that you can navigate to in the sidebar.

Data was pre-processed by removing URL's, Capital letters, Hashtags, Stopwords, Mentions(@), Punctuation, Special characters.
