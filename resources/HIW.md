###  How the app works

This process requires the user to input text
(ideally a tweet relating to climate change), and will
classify it according to whether or not they believe in
climate change.Below you will find information about the data source
and a brief data description. You can have a look at word clouds and
other general EDA on the EDA page, and make your predictions on the
prediction page that you can navigate to in the sidebar.
